# Assignment 1 — Student class (C++)

A C++ exercise assignment that demonstrates a simple `student` class with
constructors, getters/setters, a destructor, and methods to display
information and a grade based on GPA.

Files
- `main.cpp` — program entry; creates several `student` objects and
	shows usage of the class.
- `student.h` — `student` class declaration.
- `student.cpp` — `student` class definition (constructors, methods,
	destructor).

Build and run (PowerShell)
1. Compile with g++ (MinGW or other GCC toolchain):

```powershell
g++ main.cpp student.cpp -o studentApp
```

2. Run the executable:

```powershell
.\studentApp.exe
```
